Overview:

This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning competition on Kaggle. The objective of the competition is to develop a robust classifier that can predict whether or not a borrower will repay their loan. 

Dataset:

The dataset provided consists of two files: lending_train.csv, which serves as the training data, and lending_topredict.csv, which contains the data for prediction. The dataset includes various features such as loan amount, employment details, borrower demographics, credit history, and more. The target variable, loan_paid, indicates whether the loan was paid (1) or not paid (0).
